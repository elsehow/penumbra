//! The executable reference spec for [`penumbra_tct`], being a *non*-incremental, *non*-sparse
//! commitment tree.
//!
//! ⚠️ Don't use this in production code: it is slower, less flexible, and less type-safe.
//!
//! This specification implements an almost-identical interface to the tiered commitment tree in the
//! main crate. However, unlike the main crate, it separates the *construction* of trees from their
//! *examination*. The types [`eternity::Builder`], [`epoch::Builder`], and [`block::Builder`] are
//! used to build trees; they support all the mutable operations of [`Eternity`](crate::Eternity),
//! [`Epoch`](crate::Epoch), and [`Block`](crate::Block), but none of their immutable observations.
//! Each builder can be built into a [`spec::Eternity`](crate::spec::Eternity),
//! [`spec::Epoch`](crate::spec::Epoch), or [`spec::Block`](crate::spec::Block), respectively, which
//! each support all the immutable methods of their main-crate counterparts.
